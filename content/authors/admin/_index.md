Ahsan works as a risk advisory consultant and internal auditor for Protiviti Middle East. My key area of focus is audit and business analytics. I use R and wide array of R packages for data cleaning and validation and to create dynamic, reproducible and interactive reports/dashboards and data visualizations. I love exploring how R and other technologies  can improve the analytics processes for individual workflows and corporations.

In addition, to audit and analytics Ahsan is proficient in corporate governance, business process design and re-engineering, supply chain management, financial & management reporting and IT reviews.

His international experience spans across Ukraine, Russia, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Egypt, Kuwait, UAE and Pakistan.
